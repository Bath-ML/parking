# Parking

### Learn how to use machine learning by working on a project
We will be using the data from the [BANES Live Car Park Occupancy](https://data.bathhacked.org/Transport/BANES-Live-Car-Park-Occupancy/u3w2-9yme/data) to form a project using machine learning. This project is going to be planned on 9th November ([see the meetup event here](https://www.meetup.com/Bath-Machine-Learning-Meetup/events/235148732/)), and until then please feel free to [join our slack server](http://bathml.herokuapp.com/) if you have any questions, or just introduce yourself!

No knowledge of Machine Learning, Git(Hub) or programming languages is required to contribute - we ask only that you have a desire to learn.
