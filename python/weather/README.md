# Weather data fetching tool

## Development
To set up your environment to run python 3.6 run the following command in bash, assuming you are in the `python/weather/` directory:

```
source env/bin/active
```

Create your own user on darksky.net and paste the API key in `secrets.py`.
It's recommended to run `git update-index assume-unchanged secrets.py` to ensure you don't accidentally commit this file.
